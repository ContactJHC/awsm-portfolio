        To sum up, I'm a recent CS graduate and experienced front-end developer with a focus on JavaScript React mobile-first development. I'm excited to join an interactive, hardworking team where I can continue to expand my knowledge of JavaScript, perfecting accessibility, performance, and responsive design. Below are my three favorite apps out of the thirteen I created and I'm looking forward to showing to you the remaining 11 left ! Until then, you can already find their summaries on my resume which I sent to you.
